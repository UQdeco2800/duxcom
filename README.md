Duxcom - proclaimed best game of DECO2800 in all time. Duxcom is also on the shortlist for game of the year, and game of the decade.

Duxcom is an action role-playing game developed by studio session 3. Its first release in 2016 was subtitled Ego Duxconis, and was published by UQ entertainment and in the United States by no-one. The updated CP1 re-release The Duck Knight Saga which included the expansion Flames of Ibis, as well as the final CP2 release as Duxcom II, were published by Focus Studying Interactive.

The defining feature of Duxcom is the ability to switch between aerial combat as a duck, and more traditional third-person action-role playing gameplay as a human. It is the third game in the DECO2800 franchise, and the first Java game to be released on consoles as well as for Windows. Players are free to play within the entirety of a procedurally generated deterministic open universe, which includes over 18 quintillion maps, many with their own sets of flora and fauna.

May or may not feature ducks.
